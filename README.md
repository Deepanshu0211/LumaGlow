# 🌈 LumaGlow – Ambient Video Background Effect

**LumaGlow** is a minimal ambient lighting effect inspired by YouTube's Ambient Mode. It uses JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas API to extract colors from a playing video in real-time and apply them as a glowing radial background. The result: a more immersive and dynamic video experience.
